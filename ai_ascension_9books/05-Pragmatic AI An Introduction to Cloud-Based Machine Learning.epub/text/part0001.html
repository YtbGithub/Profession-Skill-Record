<p class="noindentb">“[This is] a sweeping guide that bridges the gap between the promise of AI and solutions to the gritty problems that must be solved to deploy real-world projects. Clear and usable, <em class="calibre5">Pragmatic</em> AI covers much more than just Python and AI algorithms.”</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><strong class="calibre6">–Christopher Brousseau</strong>, founder and CEO of Surface Owl, the Enterprise AI platform</p>
<p class="noindentb">“A fantastic addition for any technology enthusiast! There is so much you can say about this book! Noah Gift really made this a practical guide for anyone involved with machine learning in the industry. Not only does it explain how one can apply machine learning on large data sets, it provides a valuable perspective on technology feedback loops. This book will benefit many data science and development teams so they can create and maintain their applications efficiently right from the beginning.”</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><strong class="calibre6">–Nivas Durairaj,</strong> technical account manager, AWS (Certified Professional Architect AWS)</p>
<p class="noindentb">“A great read if you want insights into building production-quality ML pipelines and tools that truly help your data engineering, data science, or data DevOps team. Even experienced developers often find themselves spinning their wheels on low-productivity tasks. Oftentimes, software books and university classes don't explain the steps needed to go into production. Noah has a gift for finding pragmatic approaches to software deployments that can really accelerate the development and delivery process. He has a focus and passion for enabling rapid software solutions that is very unique.</p>
<p class="noindentb">“The key to building production-quality ML pipelines is automation. Tasks and steps, which engineers may do manually during the research or prototype phase, must be automated and scaled in order to create a production system. This book is full of practical and fun exercises that will help any Python developer automate and extend their pipelines into the cloud.</p>
<p class="noindentb">“I'm currently working with big data, ML pipelines, Python, AWS, Google cloud, and Azure at <a href="http://Roofstock.com" class="calibre7">Roofstock.com</a>, an online real estate company. Our analytics database is approaching 500 million rows! Within this book I found many practical tips and exercises that will immediately improve my own productivity. Recommended!”</p>
