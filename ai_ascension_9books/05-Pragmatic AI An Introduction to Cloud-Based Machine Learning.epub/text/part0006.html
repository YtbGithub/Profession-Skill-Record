<p class="noindent">About twenty years ago I was working at Caltech in Pasadena and I dreamed of someday working with AI on a daily basis. At the time, in the early 2000s, it was not a popular time to be interested in AI. Despite that, here we are, and this book culminates a lifelong obsession with AI and science fiction. I feel very lucky to have rubbed elbows with some of top people in AI while at Caltech, and undoubtedly this experience led me down the road to writing this book.</p>
<p class="noindent">Beyond just AI, however, I have also had an obsession with both automation and pragmatism. This book incorporates those themes as well. As a seasoned, experienced manager, consistently shipping products and surviving terrible, horrible, no-good technology has made me practical. If it isn’t deployed into production, it doesn’t count. If it isn’t automated, it is broken. Hopefully this book will inspire others to share my point of view.</p>
<h3 class="calibre12">Who Should Read This Book</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is for anyone interested in AI, Machine Learning, the cloud, and any combination of those topics. Programmers and non-programmers alike should be able to find useful nuggets of knowledge. Many students with whom I have interacted in workshops at NASA, PayPal, or the University of California, Davis, have been able to assimilate these notebooks and ideas with limited or no prior programming experience. Python is used heavily in this book, and it is one of the most ideal languages to pick up if you are new to programming.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the same time, there are many advanced topics covered like using cloud computing platforms (i.e., AWS, GCP, and Azure) and doing ML and AI programming. For advanced technologists who are fluent in Python, the cloud, and Machine Learning, there are many useful ideas that can be immediately transplanted into current work.</p>

<h3 class="calibre12">Example Code</h3>
<p class="noindent">Throughout the book, each chapter has a companion Jupyter Notebook or set of Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks have been developed throughout the last couple of years as the result of articles, workshops, or courses I have taught.</p>

<p class="noindent">Makefiles are a great way to orchestrate the different aspects of a data science project in Python or R. Notably, they are useful at setting up an environment, linting source code, running tests, and deploying code. Additionally, isolated environments like virtualenv do eliminate a whole class of problems. It is amazing how many students I encounter that have exactly the same issue: they installed something to one Python interpreter but use another. Or they cannot get something to work because two packages conflict with each other.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, the answer to this is to use a virtual environment for each project and to be judicious about always selecting that environment when you work on that project. A little bit of project planning goes a long way toward preventing issues in the future. Including Makefiles, linting, Jupyter Notebook tests, SaaS build systems, and unit tests are best practices that should be replicated and encouraged.</p>
