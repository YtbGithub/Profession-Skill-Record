<p class="noindent">I am grateful to Laura Lewin who gave me the opportunity to publish this book with Pearson, as well as the rest of the team: Malobika Chakraborty and Sheri Replin. I would also like to thank the technical reviewers: Chao-Hsuan Shen (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucashsuan/" class="calibre7">https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucashsuan/</a>), Kennedy Behrman (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedybehrman/" class="calibre7">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedybehrman/</a>), and Guy Ernest (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyernest/" class="calibre7">https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyernest/</a>) from Amazon. They played an important role in getting the book into tip-top shape.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, I would like to acknowledge Caltech. My interest in AI was formed when I worked at Caltech during the AI winter of the early 2000s. I remember one professor at Caltech telling me that AI was a waste of time, but I remember thinking I wanted to do it anyway. I then set a goal for myself that I would be doing significant AI programming by the time I was in my early 40s, and that I would be fluent in several programming languages—and this actually happened. Telling me I cannot do something has always been a huge motivator for me, so thank you to that professor!</p>
<p class="noindent">I also met some really influential people there including Dr. Joseph Bogen, a neurophysiologist who was an expert in theories of consciousness. We would have dinner conversations about neural networks, the origins of consciousness, calculus, and work he was doing in Christof Koch’s lab. To say he had an influence on my life is understatement, and I am proud to say that I am actually working on neural networks today partially because of dinner conversations we had 18 years ago.</p>
<p class="noindent">There were other people I met at Caltech that I didn’t interact with as much but who still had an impact on me: Dr. David Baltimore (whom I worked for), Dr. David Goodstein (whom I worked for), Dr. Fei-Fei Li, and Dr. Titus Brown (who got me hooked on Python).</p>
<p class="noindent">Sports and athletic training have always played a huge role in my life. At one point I was serious about playing professional basketball, track, and even Ultimate Frisbee. I ran into Sheldon Blockburger, an Olympic Decathlete, at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he taught me how to run 8 × 200-m intervals in under 27 seconds and 300-m intervals until I puked. I still remember him saying that “less than 1 percent of the population has the discipline to do this workout.” This training in self-discipline has played a huge role in my development as a software engineer.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have always gravitated toward being around world-class athletes because of their intensity, positive outlook, and willingness to win. In the last several years, I accidently discovered Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) by working out at Empower in San Francisco, California. The coaches there—Tareq Azim, Yossef Azim, and Josh McDonald—have all played a huge role in getting me thinking like a fighter. In particular, Josh McDonald, a world-class athlete in multiple sports, has been an inspiration to me, and his workouts have played a huge role in me getting through this book. I cannot recommend this gym or these coaches enough to technical professionals in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="noindent">These initial contacts have led to meeting more people in the martial arts community, like NorCal Fight Alliance in Santa Rosa, run by Dave Terrell. I train with Dave Terrell, Jacob Hardgrove, Collin Hart, Justin Sommer, and others, and they selflessly share their knowledge and thoughts on martial arts. There is nothing more challenging that I have experienced yet in life than having a 240-pound black belt squeeze the life out of me over and over again, day after day. Knowing that I can withstand that has been helpful in withstanding the pressures of writing this book. I am very fortunate to be able to train at this gym, and I highly recommend it for technology professionals in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xvii"></span>The last acknowledgment, on the BJJ front, I have to also thank Maui Jiu Jitsu, in Haiku, Maui, for serving as a muse to writing this book. I took a break last year to figure out what I wanted to do next and trained with Professor Luis Heredia and Joel Bouhey. They were both incredible teachers, and that experience was very helpful in deciding to write this book.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thanks to Zak Stone, the Product Manager for TensorFlow, for early access to TPUs and help with GCP. Thanks also to Guy Ernest at AWS for advice on AWS services. Thanks to Paul Shealy from Microsoft for advice on Azure cloud.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another institution I need to thank is UC Davis. I received my MBA in 2013, and it had a big impact on my life. I was able to meet some incredible professors like Dr. David Woodruff, who let me program in Python for the Optimization class and helped write a really powerful library called Pyomo. I must also thank Professor Dickson Louie, who has been a great mentor to me, and Dr. Hemant Bhargava, who gave me the opportunity to teach Machine Learning at UC Davis. Dr. Norm Matloff has also selflessly helped me get better at Machine Learning and Statistics, and I am very grateful to him. I am also thankful to the students in my course BAX-452, who got to try out some of this material, and the MSBA staff: Amy Russell and Shachi Govil. Another friend to thank is Mario Izquierdo (<a href="https://github.com/marioizquierdo" class="calibre7">https://github.com/marioizquierdo</a>), who is a brilliant developer and has been a great person to throw programming ideas around about real world deployment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lastly, I would like to thank a couple of my friends from my startup days: Jerry Castro  (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-castro-4bbb631/" class="calibre7">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-castro-4bbb631/</a>) and Kennedy Behrman (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedybehrman/" class="calibre7">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedybehrman/</a>), who are as reliable, hard-working, and resilient  as they come. Much of the material for this book was developed while we worked side by side in the trenches at a startup that ultimately failed. It is experiences like this that reveal the true character of individuals, and I am honored to have been their coworker and friend.</p>
